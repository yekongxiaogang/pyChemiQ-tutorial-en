==================================

Classes
----------

.. py:class:: Molecules(geometry=None, basis=None, multiplicity=None, charge=0, active=None, nfrozen=None)

    Initialize the electronic structure parameters of molecules, including charge, base group, atomic coordinates, spin multiplicity, etc

   :param str geometry: Enter the type and coordinates of atoms in the molecule. It can be a string type or a string list. For example: geometry="H 0 00, H 0 0 0.74" or geometry=["H 0 00", "H 0 0 0.74"]
   :param str basic: Enter the base group level for performing calculations. The currently supported basis set are Gaussian function basis groups such as MINI, sto-3G, sto-6G, 3-21G, 6-31G, etc. Polarization and dispersion basis sets are not supported.
   :param int multiplicity: The spin multiplicity of the input molecular system. The relationship with the total spin quantum number of molecules is M=2S+1. Currently, pyChemiQ only supports RHF singlet calculations, and UHF and ROHF are under development.
   :param int charge: Input the charge of the molecular system.
   :param list [int] active: The active space of a molecular system, formatted as [m, n], where m is the number of active orbitals and n is the number of active electrons. By default, no active space is set.
   :param int nfrozen: The number of frozen orbitals in a molecular system, starting from the molecular orbital with the lowest energy and freezing the electrons in that orbital. The default is not to set frozen tracks.

   :return: Output the result of executing HF calculation.
