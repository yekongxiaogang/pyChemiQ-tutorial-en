FAQ
=================================
Q: Is pyChemiQ dependent on other function packages?

A: PyChemiQ relies on the numpy function package (version greater than 1.19). If installing using the Linux version, it is necessary to ensure that the system glibc version is greater than or equal to 2.29.
