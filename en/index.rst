pyChemiQ
====================================
PyChemiQ is a python software library developed by Origin Quantum, which can be used to simulate and calculate the fermionic system on a real Quantum computer or virtual machine. Support user-defined mapping, ansatz, and optimizers, facilitating user secondary development. This software package provides a simple, lightweight and efficient platform for Quantum chemistry calculation and method development. PyChemiQ can be used to solve Quantum chemistry problems by using the mean field and post mean field methods to simulate molecules on a Quantum computer. PyChemiQ simplifies the conversion between molecular structure input and quantum circuits, minimizes the domain expertise required to enter the field, and makes it easier for interested scholars to solve and study electronic structure problems on Quantum computer.

At present, pyChemiQ supports inputting molecular structures to derive the second-quantized Fermion Hamiltonian; In terms of mapping, pyChemiQ supports Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation, Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) transformation, Parity transformation and Multilayer Segmented Parity (MSP)
transformation methods to map the second-quantized Fermion Hamiltonian operators to Pauli Hamiltonian operators on quantum computers; In terms of ansatz, pyChemiQ also supports different ansatz to construct quantum circuits, such as Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC), Hardware-Efficient, symmetry-preserved, etc; In terms of optimization, pyChemiQ provides several classical optimizers for optimizing variational parameters: NELDER-MEAD, POWELL, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B, SLSQP, and Gradient Descent. Users can also construct or optimize the Quantum circuit by themselves to obtain the optimal ground state energy solution of the electronic structure problem through user-defined mapping and ansatz.
